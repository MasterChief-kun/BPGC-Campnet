* BPGC-Campnet
A set of scripts to automate logging in to the campus network at BPGC.
** Linux (Network Manager)
The NetworkManager dispatcher calls scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ directory whenever a network event occurs. These scripts respond to changes like connections, disconnections, and IP address assignments.
1. Add your credentials to `connect`.
        #+BEGIN_SRC bash
username="<campnet-username>"
password="<campnet-password>"
        #+END_SRC
2. Move the script to `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/`
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo cp connect /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/
   #+END_SRC
3. Make the script executable
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/connect
   #+END_SRC
** iOS/iPad (Shortcuts & Automations)
